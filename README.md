This project provides practical examples and utilities to help you understand and leverage streams in your own Java applications.

## Prerequisites
- **Java 8 or later**: The Streams API was introduced in Java 8.
- **Maven**: This project uses Maven for dependency management and building.
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with terminal access.
